# TreeClicker

A Game designed and created by William DeDominco (yes they named the nation after him), Zachary Bauman, & Colby Johnson (the grandchild of Magic Johnson but albino btw) for the Mobile Makers Final Unit App (Yay).

Anyways, this game is created in swift and storyboard via XCode, and is designed for Apple devices only.

The baseline is that the user presses the big red button to hit the tree and progress to further chop down the tree and earn money. Furthermore, the money can be used to purchase further upgrades including axes (increases the progress made in chopping the tree down), workers (passive income for the user), & trees (resets the user's current money balance but allows the user to earn more money from the tree being chopped down).

There's also some user feedback (brought you by yours truly) with the power of a lot of math and calculations + popups for the different shop menus (good job Will).
